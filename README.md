# SPDR_ETFs_stats.GARCH
Exploring relationships between S&amp;P 500 sectors and modelling historical volatility.

This repo computes interesting statistics--including historical average returns, volatilities, Sharpe ratios, and correlations--on the 10 sector SPDR ETFs that track each industry represented in the S&P 500 Index. 

In addition, a modest GARCH model is utilized to estimate historical daily volatility for two of the 10 ETFs, namely the funds that represent the financial and energy sectors. These two funds were selected for further analysis because of recent market events.

Below are the main plots from the script. Additional tables can be found in the full version of the code which is also provided as part of this repo.
